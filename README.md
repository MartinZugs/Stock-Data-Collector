# Stock-Data-Scraper
This is a Docker file that is run using kubernetes on my raspbery pis that utilizes the World Trading Data API to pull data down for given stocks and pushes that data to a Python Flask API that I built that adds the data to a MySQL server database located on another one of my Raspberry Pis.
